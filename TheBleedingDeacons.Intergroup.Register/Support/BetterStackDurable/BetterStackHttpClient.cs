	/// <summary>
	/// <see cref="IHttpClient"/> implementation used by Serilog.Sinks.Http's durable sink
	/// to POST batches of NDJSON log events to the Better Stack ingest endpoint.
	///
	/// Responsibilities:
	///  • Attach the Bearer source token to every request (Better Stack requires it).
	///  • Tag the content as application/x-ndjson, matching what <see cref="BetterStackNdjsonBatchFormatter"/>
	///    writes — Better Stack parses one JSON event per line.
	///  • Reuse the app's platform-native <see cref="HttpClient"/> so log uploads use the same TLS
	///    stack as the rest of the app (see <c>MauiProgram.CreateHttpClient</c> for the WAF-fingerprint
	///    rationale — if API calls can get through, so can log uploads).
	///
	/// The durable sink calls <see cref="PostAsync(string, Stream, CancellationToken)"/>. If the POST
	/// fails (offline, 5xx, TLS error, etc.) the sink keeps the batch on disk and retries later.
	/// No log events are lost as long as the buffer file survives, which it does across process
	/// kills — that is the whole point.
