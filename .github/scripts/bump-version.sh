# Computes the next version from the commits just merged to main, and writes it
# into the Register csproj.
#
# Rules (see .github/workflows/version.yml):
#   any `feat:` commit  -> minor bump, patch reset to 0
#   anything else       -> patch bump
#   never major         -> a major release is a deliberate act, taken by hand
#
# ApplicationVersion — the Android versionCode — advances by one alongside it.
# It is what decides whether a build can update an existing install, so it must
# never go backwards or stall.
#
# This runs on push to main, not on the pull request. Bumping in the PR put the
# branch's final commit under github-actions[bot], and GitHub will not run
# checks on a bot-authored head unaided — the runs either sat blocked at
# `action_required`, or with [skip ci] never queued at all. Either way the
# commit that actually merged was the one commit nobody built. Versioning after
# the merge keeps pull requests fully checked; the cost is that the version a
# change ships as is decided at merge rather than visible in review.
#
# Usage:  bump-version.sh <commit-range>
#   e.g.  bump-version.sh abc123..def456
# Local dry run against the last merge:
#   .github/scripts/bump-version.sh HEAD~1..HEAD
